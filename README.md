My Advent of Code 2023 solutions. This year I've chosen to attempt solving the puzzles using Node.js

## Tests

Note: no inputs or outputs (even to the unit tests) are included to the repo per [Advent of Code legal notice referenced in reddit /r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/).

If you wish to check the code with unit tests, place input as file named `test-input[2]{0,1}` and output as file named `test-output[2]{0,1}` to the day folder you wish to run tests for. Input without number is used for puzzle 1 and input with suffix "2" is used for puzzle 2. Tests regarding utils utilize puzzle input from day-1 folder, so they will fail if you haven't set your puzzle input within the day-1 folder.
